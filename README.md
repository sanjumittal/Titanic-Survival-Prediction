# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

## 📌 Task Objectives
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

### **Key Features:**
✔ Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)  
✔ Model Training (Random Forest Classifier)  
✔ Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## 🚀 Steps to Run the Project

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- Open `notebooks/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` to explore the analysis.

### **4️⃣ Train the Model**
Run the Python script in `src/` to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance
The model achieves **high accuracy** in predicting survival, evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Classification Report

## 🏆 Future Improvements
🔹 Try different ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)  
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
🔹 Feature engineering to extract more insights
